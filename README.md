#### Project Inspiration
The creation of this project was inspired by one of my favorite activities while going through the lessons each week of CS50x.
I would always pause the lectures at the start and spend a couple minutes translating what the messages meant.
Since I enjoyed it so much I decided to write a [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@efeogheneerhie.o/why-i-have-to-watch-every-cs50-2021-video-57cffa012e04) that recorded all the messages I had translated.
Then since I had spent so long on this, I decided to leverage all that work by making it the core concept in my CS50 final project.
So my project is all about the lights and hidden message of CS50x 2022.
The design of the front end and a little of the back end is based on a different project I completed as part of the [Zero To Mastery](https://zerotomastery.io/) web development course called [smartbrain](https://github.com/Byte-bit-Byte/smartbrain).
The API architecture used for the CS50 Lights back end server was largely based on the one use in this video by [productioncoder](https://youtu.be/wfrn21E2NaU).
