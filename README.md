# Description:
## Project Inspiration
	The creation of this project was inspired by one of my favorite activities while going through the lessons each week of CS50x.
	I would always pause the lectures at the start and spend a couple minutes translating what the messages meant.
	Since I enjoyed it so much I decided to write a [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@efeogheneerhie.o/why-i-have-to-watch-every-cs50-2021-video-57cffa012e04) that recorded all the messages I had translated.
	Then since I had spent so long on this, I decided to leverage all that work by making it the core concept in my CS50 final project.
	So my project is all about the lights and hidden messages of CS50x 2022.

	The design of the front end and a little of the back end is based on a different project I completed as part of the [Zero To Mastery](https://zerotomastery.io/) web development course called [smartbrain](https://github.com/Byte-bit-Byte/smartbrain).
	The API architecture used for the CS50 Lights back end server was largely based on the one used in this video by [productioncoder](https://youtu.be/wfrn21E2NaU).

## Project Structure Overview
	The project was created with mostly Javascript and it can be broken into three broad sections. 
	- The Front End which is created using the front end library React.js. 
	- The back end which is created using Express.js library.
	- The database which is created using postgres, but can easily be modified to a different database because of the use of the knex.js library. The database itself is not part of the project files. 

	I will discuss each section in more detail below.

## Front End App Details
	The front end of the application was created using the React.js front end library because of how fast and convenient. I will first describe the different aspects of the application that a user can experience when opening the website. Then I will describe how each of the different components of the website were designed and how they function.
